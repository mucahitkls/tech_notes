Let's explain this snippet code even simpler way like we are five years old.

### Many to Many: `Student` and `Class`

Imagine a party with kids (Students) and games (Classes). Kids can play many games, and each game can be played by many kids.

- `Student` is like a kid at the party. Each kid has an ID.
- `Class` is like a game at the party. Each game has an ID.
- The `students_classes_association` is like a list of which kid played which game.
- The `relationship` in `Student` tells us that kids can play many games, and it uses this list to keep track.

### `relationship` Function

In SQLAlchemy, `relationship` is used to establish a connection between two classes (which represent tables in a database). It's like telling a story about how two things are related. For instance, an `Article` can have many `Comments`. By using `relationship`, we can easily access the related objects. Think of it like saying, "This toy (Article) can have many stickers (Comments), and I can see all the stickers on it easily."

### Back Populates

`back_populates` is used to create a two-way relationship. It tells SQLAlchemy that two classes should know about each other. In the case of `Person` and `MobilePhone`, it’s like saying, “I have a mobile phone, and my mobile phone knows it’s mine.”

- In `Person`, the `mobile_phone` relationship says, "This person has a mobile phone."
- In `MobilePhone`, the `person` relationship says, "This mobile phone belongs to a person."
- `back_populates` makes sure that if you update one side (like giving a person a new phone), the other side (the phone knowing who its owner is) gets updated too.

### Association Table

For a many-to-many relationship (like `Student` and `Class`), we need something extra – an association table (`students_classes_association`). This is like a guest list for a party, where you list which kid (Student) played which game (Class).

- This table doesn't represent a class in our code. It's just a way to link students and classes.
- It has two columns, each a foreign key linking to the `id` of a `Student` and a `Class`.
- When you add a `Student` to a `Class`, you're actually adding an entry to this association table, saying, "This student is taking this class."

### Summary

- **`relationship`** is your tool to connect classes. It's like making a friendship between two things.
- **`back_populates`** ensures that both friends know about their relationship.
- An **association table** is used when many friends (students) can join many games (classes), and you need to keep track of who joined what.
