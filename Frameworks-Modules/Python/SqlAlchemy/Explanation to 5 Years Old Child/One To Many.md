### One to Many: `Article` and `Comment`

Imagine you have a toy (Article) and this toy can have many stickers (Comments). Each sticker belongs to just one toy, but the toy can have many stickers.

- `Article` is like our toy. It has an ID to tell it apart from other toys.
- `Comment` is like a sticker. It has its own ID and knows which toy (article_id) it belongs to.
- The `relationship` in `Article` tells us that one toy can have many stickers.

### `relationship` Function

In SQLAlchemy, `relationship` is used to establish a connection between two classes (which represent tables in a database). It's like telling a story about how two things are related. For instance, an `Article` can have many `Comments`. By using `relationship`, we can easily access the related objects. Think of it like saying, "This toy (Article) can have many stickers (Comments), and I can see all the stickers on it easily."
