Kanban methodology is about day-to-day workflows and processes. It is a simple, visual means of managing projects that enables teams to see the progress so far and what's coming up next. Kanban projects are primarily managed through a Kanban board, which segments tasks into three columns: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done"

Many project management software solutions have Kanban board integration, which teams can use to plot out a task's progress from start to finish.

The main benefit of this methodology is the increased transparency, allowing team leaders to clearly see which tasks are assigned to which team members and what is yet to be completed to make meaningful progress.
