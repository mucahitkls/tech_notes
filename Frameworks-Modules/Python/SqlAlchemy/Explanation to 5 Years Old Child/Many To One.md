Let's explain this snippet code even simpler way like we are five years old.
### Many to One: `Tire` and `Car`

Now think of cars (Car) and tires (Tire). One car can have many tires, but each tire fits only one car.

- `Car` is like our car toy. It has an ID.
- `Tire` is like a tire for the car. It knows which car (car_id) it goes on.
- The `relationship` in `Tire` tells us that this tire is made for a specific car.


### `relationship` Function

In SQLAlchemy, `relationship` is used to establish a connection between two classes (which represent tables in a database). It's like telling a story about how two things are related. For instance, an `Article` can have many `Comments`. By using `relationship`, we can easily access the related objects. Think of it like saying, "This toy (Article) can have many stickers (Comments), and I can see all the stickers on it easily."
