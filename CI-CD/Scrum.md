Scrum is one of the most popular Agile methodologies, as it can bring teams together with a sharp focus and an efficient, collaborative approach to task execution.

It is similar to [[Kanban]] in many ways. Scrum typically uses a Scrum board, similar to Kanban board, and groups tasks into columns based on progress. Unlike Kanban, Scrum focuses on breaking a project down into sprints and only planning and managing one sprint at a time.

Under this methodology ,you would assign a Scrum leader and product owner, who have a direct influence over the rest of the team. This assigned leadership can help teams to spearhead projects and complete them over a short space of time through a series of sprints.

Sprints are the Scrum way of breaking projects down into iterations that can last anywhere between one and four weeks each. Bringing team members together from different departments, these sprints help you channel a collective focus your projects.

Scrum also features a robust set of principles and activities that dictate how you work. These include:
> *Sprint Planning*: Planning sessions to identify the purpose beyond your sprints
> *Roles*: Key roles in the Scrum project management process
> *Product backlog*: A list of tasks arranged according to priority level
