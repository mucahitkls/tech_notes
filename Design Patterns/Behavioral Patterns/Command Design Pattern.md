## Understanding the Command Design Pattern

The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral [[Design Patterns in Software Development|design pattern]] that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations. Essentially, it encapsulates a request as an [[Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)|object]], thereby allowing for the parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

## Why Use the Command Pattern?

1. **Separation of Concerns**: It decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.

2. **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code, adhering to the open/closed principle.

3. **Composite Commands**: You can compose multiple commands into a single command.

4. **Support for Undo/Redo**: Since commands are objects with all necessary information, you can store a history of commands for undo/redo functionality.

5. **Flexibility in Execution**: Commands can be executed immediately or held and executed at a later time.

## How Do We Use the Command Pattern?

To implement the Command pattern:

1. **Command Interface**: An interface that declares a method for executing a command.

2. **Concrete Command**: Implements the command interface and defines the binding between a Receiver object and an action.

3. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request.

4. **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operations.

5. **Client**: Creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.

## When to Use the Command Pattern?

- When you need to parameterize objects according to an action to perform.
  
- When you need to create and execute requests at different times.

- When you need to support undo functionality.

- When the history of requests is required.

## JavaScript Example of Command Pattern

### Scenario: Simple Remote Control

Imagine you're creating a simple remote control that can execute different actions like turning on a light or a TV.

#### Without Command:

Initially, you might directly call methods of the objects.

```javascript
class Light {
    on() {
        console.log("Light is on");
    }
}

class TV {
    on() {
        console.log("TV is on");
    }
}

// Usage
const light = new Light();
const tv = new TV();

light.on();
tv.on();
```

#### With Command:

```javascript
// Command Interface
class Command {
    execute() {}
}

// Concrete Commands
class LightOnCommand extends Command {
    constructor(light) {
        super();
        this.light = light;
    }

    execute() {
        this.light.on();
    }
}

class TVOnCommand extends Command {
    constructor(tv) {
        super();
        this.tv = tv;
    }

    execute() {
        this.tv.on();
    }
}

// Receiver
class Light {
    on() {
        console.log("Light is on");
    }
}

class TV {
    on() {
        console.log("TV is on");
    }
}

// Invoker
class RemoteControl {
    submit(command) {
        command.execute();
    }
}

// Usage
const light = new Light();
const tv = new TV();

const lightOnCommand = new LightOnCommand(light);
const tvOnCommand = new TVOnCommand(tv);

const remote = new RemoteControl();
remote.submit(lightOnCommand); // Light is on
remote.submit(tvOnCommand); // TV is on
```

**Improvements**: 
- **[[Decoupling in Software Development|Decoupling]]**: The remote control (Invoker) is decoupled from the devices it controls (Receivers). It knows nothing about the device's implementation.
- **[[Flexibility in Software Development|Flexibility]]**: New commands for different devices can be added without changing the existing code.
- **Extensibility**: The system is easy to extend with new commands and receivers.

## Python Example of Command Pattern

### Scenario: Document Editor

Imagine you're creating a document editor that can perform various text operations like copy, paste, and undo.

#### Without Command:

Initially, you might directly execute operations on the document.

```python
class Document:
    def copy(self):
        print("Text copied")

    def paste(self):
        print("Text pasted")

# Usage
doc = Document()
doc.copy()
doc.paste()
```

#### With Command:

```python
# Command Interface
class Command:
    def execute(self):
        pass

# Concrete Commands
class CopyCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, document):
        self.document = document

    def execute(self):
        self.document.copy()

class PasteCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, document):
        self.document = document

    def execute(self):
        self.document.paste()

# Receiver
class Document:
    def copy(self):
        print("Text copied")

    def paste(self):
        print("Text pasted")

# Invoker
class MenuOptions:
    def __init__(self, copy_command, paste_command):
        self.copy_command = copy_command
        self.paste_command = paste_command

    def click_copy(self):
        self.copy_command.execute()

    def click_paste(self):
        self.paste_command.execute()

# Usage
doc = Document()
copy_command = CopyCommand(doc)
paste_command = PasteCommand(doc)

menu = MenuOptions(copy_command, paste_command)
menu.click_copy()  # Text copied
menu.click_paste()  # Text pasted
```

**Improvements**: 
- **Decoupling**: The `MenuOptions` (Invoker) is decoupled from the `Document` (Receiver). It doesn't need to know how copy and paste operations are performed.
- **Undo Functionality**: You can extend this pattern to support undo functionality by keeping a history of executed commands.
- **Dynamic Command Execution**: Commands can be added, removed, or modified at runtime, providing dynamic behavior.

See an extensive [[Command Design Pattern in Real-Life Coding|example]].

In both examples, the Command pattern allows you to encapsulate requests as objects, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It provides a mechanism to decouple the invoker of an action from the object that knows how to perform it. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to implement features like undo/redo, logging, transactions, and more.
