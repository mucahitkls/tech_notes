Let's explain this snippet code even simpler way like we are five years old.

### One to One: `Person` and `MobilePhone`

This is like you and your hat. You have one hat and that hat is just for you.

- `Person` is like you. You have an ID.
- `MobilePhone` is like your hat. It has an ID and knows who it belongs to (person_id).
- The `relationship` in `Person` uses `uselist=False`, meaning you can only have one hat (mobile phone).

### `relationship` Function

In SQLAlchemy, `relationship` is used to establish a connection between two classes (which represent tables in a database). It's like telling a story about how two things are related. For instance, an `Article` can have many `Comments`. By using `relationship`, we can easily access the related objects. Think of it like saying, "This toy (Article) can have many stickers (Comments), and I can see all the stickers on it easily."

### Back Populates

`back_populates` is used to create a two-way relationship. It tells SQLAlchemy that two classes should know about each other. In the case of `Person` and `MobilePhone`, it’s like saying, “I have a mobile phone, and my mobile phone knows it’s mine.”

- In `Person`, the `mobile_phone` relationship says, "This person has a mobile phone."
- In `MobilePhone`, the `person` relationship says, "This mobile phone belongs to a person."
- `back_populates` makes sure that if you update one side (like giving a person a new phone), the other side (the phone knowing who its owner is) gets updated too.
